    RPGs were never really my style, but we managed to make an interesting and rather detailed game in the end. I certainly had fun digging deeper into graphics programming, especially as it was all so new at the time. Though, I can't help but to feel some envy toward all the gameplay programmers, the work there was also really cool!

    what I did: engine programming: core engine class, instantiation of all systems, core game logic loop (keeping track of framerate), system manager (a class that manages all systems within a vector), menu system (the buttons), camera code (queues effects and attributes are deserialized through rapidJSON API so designers can change what the camera does), shader programming (post-processing).
