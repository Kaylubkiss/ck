    Survival horror seemed like an interesting challenge for the bunch of us programmers and designers. No actual artists or musicians involved, we are currently investing hard into making art pipelines to create a stylistic and scary experience for players, with some game design twists that some haven't seen in a horror game before.

    What I did: enemy AI & sound design & animation code, pixelation shader, co-wrote player character gameplay code. 

​

Currently working on: character models & general sound design.

​

Contribution Goals: provide more nuance to enemy behavior, help create more assets for the game, add lighting to shader.
